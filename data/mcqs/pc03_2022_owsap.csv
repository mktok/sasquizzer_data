This can be overdone by ",(a) An SCA scan ,(b) Disabling XML external entity processing also reduces the likelihood of an XML entity attack ,(c) Both A&B ,(d) None of the given,C
16. Pick the correct regarding Broken Control Access ,"(a) If authentication and access restriction are not properly implemented, it's easy for attackers to take whatever they want. With broken access control flaws, unauthenticated or unauthorized users may have access to sensitive files and systems, or even user privilege settings. ",(b) Configuration errors and insecure access control practices are hard to detect as automated processes cannot always test for them. ,"(c) Penetration testing can detect missing authentication, but other methods must be used to determine configuration problems. Weak access controls and issues with credentials management are preventable with secure coding practices, as well as preventative measures like locking down administrative accounts and controls and using multi-factor authentication.",(d) All of the above,D
"17. Just like misconfigured access controls, more general security configuration errors are huge risks that give attackers quick, easy access to sensitive data and site areas. This can be reduced by ",(a) Static Testing ,(b) Dynamic Testing ,(c) SCA Testing ,(d) All of the above,B
